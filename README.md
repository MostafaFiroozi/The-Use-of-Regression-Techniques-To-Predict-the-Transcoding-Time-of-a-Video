# The-Use-of-Regression-Techniques-To-Predict-the-Transcoding-Time-of-a-Video
In this project, we are using a database containing the parameters related to several videos on the web and we are aiming to predict the total transcoding time for transcoding them.<br/>
**Note:** Since we will be using heavy regressors like SVM, and regarding the limited capacity of our local hardware, we used google colab environment.<br/>
## Data Import And Preparation.<br/>
Since we are using google colab, the primary cell of the code is to allow the colab to have access to my google drive to read the CSV file.<br/>
